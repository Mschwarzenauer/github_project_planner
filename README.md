  <h3>1. Project Title</h3>
  <p><strong>Smart Event Planner</strong></p>

  <h3>2. Project Idea</h3>
  <p>
    This website helps users plan and organize events of any kind — from birthday parties 
    and weddings to business meetings and workshops. It includes tools for managing tasks, 
    tracking budgets, setting deadlines, and assigning responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    This topic is useful because many people struggle with organizing events efficiently. 
    A digital planner makes the process smoother, more structured, and less stressful.
